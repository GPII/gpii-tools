# gpii-tools

Small tools and utilities for working with the GPII

This repository is a collection of utilities and tools for development, debugging, and management of the GPII. Each directory is a standalone tool, different entries may be written in different languages/scripts and target different hardware and platforms. Each tool should include it's own README that discusses it's purpose, use, and how to build/run it.

This collection is meant as a organizational convenience, but should be used at your own risk. Different tools may be of different maturity and maintenance levels. Some may no longer be under development, but included here as a useful reference and archive. Again, consult the README for each tool.

## Contents

These are small command line applications, mostly written in javascript and jq for querying the GPII CouchDB instances,
cloud endpoints, and working with the various JSON payloads.
